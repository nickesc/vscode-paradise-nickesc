## Acknowledgements:

This is a fork of the VSCode theme [paradise/vscode](https://github.com/paradise-theme/vscode). I was having issues with the theme and the color choices weren't quite matching up to what I'd hoped they would be, so I decided to build my own. Heavy lifting was done by [paradise](https://github.com/paradise-theme), see the no-VSCode parts of the theme at [paradise-theme/paradise](https://github.com/paradise-theme/paradise) .
